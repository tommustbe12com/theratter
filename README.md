A RAT (Remote Access Tool) that allows for running of commands and for sending messages. Non-destructive, unless you give it admin privileges.
## usage
Install SERVER.exe on the TARGET machine's startup folder in Windows. If you don't run on startup, you can't maintain control!
Run once on Server.exe for firewall issue resolving.

Install CLIENT.exe and run on YOUR computer. This doesn't run in the background, it only runs once. after you close it it's rly gone. However in the target's machine it runs in bg >:)

## btw
Anyways DONT use this against people pls I just made it for fun keep it fun :>
